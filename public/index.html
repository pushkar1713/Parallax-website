        <h2 class="secHeading">My favourite stories</h2>
        <p class="text">
          Hello, My name is Pushkar and I am just an avid consumer of popular
          storytelling mediums like novels, films, manga, anime, tv shows and
          graphic novels.
          <br /><br />
          Stories can also evoke feelings within us, whether we know the
          individual or not. Good stories can make us feel excitement, anger,
          sadness, empathy, or enthusiasm. Our emotional reaction can mean we
          feel something towards the person telling the story, which helps
          create connection.
          <br /><br />
          This is a list of my favourite pieces of storytelling.
        </p>

        <div class="bg bg1">
          <h2 class="desc">RED RISING SAGA</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Darrow would have lived in peace, but his enemies brought him war. The
          Gold overlords demanded his obedience, hanged his wife, and enslaved
          his people. But Darrow is determined to fight back. Risking everything
          to transform himself and breach Gold society, Darrow has battled to
          survive the cutthroat rivalries that breed Society‚Äôs mightiest
          warriors, climbed the ranks, and waited patiently to unleash the
          revolution that will tear the hierarchy apart from within.
          <br /><br />
          When I started reading this I did not expected it to be this good. I
          love how each book is much better than the previous one. Darrow is my
          favourite fictional protagonist and the cast is top- tier as well. I
          am not ready to say goodbye to this story in the last book.
        </p>

        <div class="bg bg2">
          <h2 class="desc">MR. ROBOT</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          "Mr. Robot" follows Elliot (Rami Malek), a young programmer who works
          as a cyber-security engineer by day and a vigilante hacker by night.
          Elliot finds himself at a crossroads when the mysterious leader
          (Christian Slater) of an underground hacker group recruits him to
          destroy the corporation he is paid to protect.
          <br /><br />
          As a Computer Science student this was a great experience for me, Rami
          Malek totally nailed the role of Elliot and how the plot develops and
          progress with each and every single episode is masterful love this
          series very much.
        </p>

        <div class="bg bg3">
          <h2 class="desc">TRUMAN SHOW</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Truman Burbank, the unwitting star of the world‚Äôs most popular TV
          show, is supposed to be an everyman. The Truman Show is set in an
          island town, Seahaven, that evokes the prefab conformities of American
          suburbia. Truman is a brand in a setting that is stridently generic.
          Since his birth, he has navigated a world manufactured‚Äîby Christof,
          the creator of his show‚Äîfor lucrative inoffensiveness. Everything
          around him exists to fulfill the primary mandate of a mass-market TV
          show: appealing to the widest possible audience.
          <br /><br />
          This is the 1st movie that I gave a full score that is 10/10. The
          whole concept of the movie is just simply fascinating to me and the
          ending or closing scence moves me too much.
          <br /><br />Good morning, and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon,
          good evening, and good night!
        </p>

        <div class="bg bg4">
          <h2 class="desc">12 ANGRY MEN</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          12 Angry Men is a 1957 film about a jury of 12 men who deliberate the
          fate of a teenager accused of murder. The jurors must put aside their
          personal conflicts to reach a verdict. The case involves a teenager
          accused of stabbing his father to death. If convicted, the boy will be
          sentenced to death.
          <br /><br />
          This is probably the most thrilling 97 mins I have experienced while
          watching a movie. Each and every dialouge and performances by the
          actors is just phenomenal.
        </p>

        <div class="bg bg5">
          <h2 class="desc">BOJACK HORSEMAN</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          A Netflix original about a former sitcom star attempting a comeback
          while also dealing with addiction and depression, BoJack Horseman
          followed an anthropomorphic horse who continually tried to dull the
          pain of his previous bad behavior with something worse. As the show
          grew in scope and fleshed out a large cast of characters, it explored
          all kinds of ideas and stories.
          <br /><br />
          Seeing how Bojack is evolving and trying to get better as a person was
          very imapactful and thought provoking, the re-watch in the laters year
          when I have more life experience gonna hit hard. The cast is amazing
          as well with a phenomenal conclusion. Couldn't have asked for anything
          more.
